Without regular scanning and monitoring you can never be sure that your network security has not been compromised. Misconfigured severs, routine maintenance, and poor software version control can all result in new vulnerabilities being introduced into the network.
 
The iStorm vulnerability assessment platform has been designed by front-line security professionals to enable scheduling of routine scans of the critical hosts, or on-demand following any changes to the network.

Using a combination of sector leading scanning engines, including Nessus, SAINT and OpenVAS, iStorm covers the broadest range of vulnerabilities compared with other proprietary scanning solutions. Built around a highly intuitive and graphical, host centric, dashboard iStorm takes the complex vulnerability scanning data from each engine and presents it in a format that can be quickly and easily interpreted even by non-security specialists.
 
Uniquely, iStorm can also be integrated with RandomStormâ€™s host intrusion detection module, StormProbe, to rapidly pinpoint and alert IT teams to any events actively threatening the network. Sharing the same presentation dashboard, the correlated vulnerability and real-time HIDS data reduces the number of false positive alerts and helps to focus limited resources on securing the critical network resources.
