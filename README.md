# Front End Developer - Markup Test

At RandomStorm we're proud of the user interface for our software, and we want people joining our team to be able to contribute to it while keeping up our high standards.

This test is pretty simple. We just want you to provide the markup and stylesheets to generate a webpage to illustrate a really rough mockup we have created.

There are no rules, but we'd like to see some evidence that you know your away around the tools of the trade and can write your own code. If you want to enhance the functionality on the page using JavaScript, feel free. If you want to consider how the site might work on a mobile device, it's up to you too.

* The mockup file [is here](assets/mock.png).
* Company logo [is here](assets/rs-logo.png).

Once you have completed both of those, pack up your code and send it to the person who sent you the link to get here!
